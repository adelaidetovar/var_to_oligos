# Variants to MPRA oligos

This repo contains R scripts to make MPRA oligos from GWAS variants. It assumes that you're starting from a list of signals and corresponding ancestries in which those signals were identified and want to perform LD expansion to generate a full list of variants. If you have already obtained your full list of variants, you can make adjustments to the `grab_info.R` script to accommodate different formatting.

## To start

`git clone https://github.com/adelaidetovar/var_to_oligos.git`
